// This file will define the AppSessionData struct.
// AppSessionData is responsible for holding and managing the core
// application's session-specific data, such as the current profile,
// file cache, and scan settings. It aims to separate this data
// from both the UI-specific state and the main application logic handler.

// Initially empty, will be populated in the next step.
