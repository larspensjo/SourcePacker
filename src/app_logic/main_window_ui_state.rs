// This file will define the MainWindowUiState struct.
// MainWindowUiState is responsible for holding and managing state
// specifically related to the main application window's UI. This includes
// things like window identifiers, mappings for UI elements (e.g., tree items),
// and UI-specific pending actions or temporary data for dialogs.

// Initially empty, will be populated in a subsequent step.
