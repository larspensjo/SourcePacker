# Refactored Plan: A Comprehensive Styling and Theming System

**Overall Status:** **Largely Implemented.** Future enhancements are tracked in the Master Development Plan.

**Goal:** To refactor the UI system to support a flexible, ID-based styling mechanism. This decouples style definitions from control creation, enabling themes like "Neon Night".

---

## Phase 1: Foundational Types for a Definable Style System
**Status:** **Complete.**
*   The core data structures (`Color`, `ControlStyle`, `StyleId`, `ParsedControlStyle`) and platform commands (`DefineStyle`, `ApplyStyleToControl`) are fully implemented in the codebase.

## Phase 2: Backend - Implementing `DefineStyle`
**Status:** **Complete.**
*   The logic to receive `DefineStyle` commands, parse them into `ParsedControlStyle` (including creating native `HFONT` and `HBRUSH` resources), and store them in the platform layer's state is implemented.

## Phase 3: Backend - Implementing `ApplyStyleToControl` and Basic Rendering
**Status:** **Complete.**
*   The logic to handle the `ApplyStyleToControl` command is implemented.
*   `WndProc` handlers for `WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC` and `WM_CTLCOLOREDIT` correctly look up applied styles and use their properties to render labels and input fields.

## Phase 4: UI Descriptive Layer Integration and Theming
**Status:** **Complete.**
*   The `ui_description_layer/theme.rs` module successfully defines the "Neon Night" theme.
*   The `build_main_window_static_layout` function correctly issues `DefineStyle` commands for the theme and `ApplyStyleToControl` commands for the UI elements. The application launches with the theme applied.

## **Future Work (Tracked in Master Development Plan)**

The foundational system is in place. The following enhancements will build upon it.

## Phase 5: Advanced Styling - Borders and Focus Effects
**Status:** **Not Started.**
*   **Next Step:** This is tracked as **Task 3.1** in the Master Development Plan.
*   **Objective:** Implement custom borders and a focus "glow" effect by handling `WM_NCPAINT`, `WM_SETFOCUS`, and `WM_KILLFOCUS`.

## Phase 6: UI Enhancement - Tooltip Support

**Objective:** Implement styled tooltips, reusing the logic from the previous plan but integrating it with the new theme.

1.  **(PL-Types) Add Tooltip Command:**
    *   **File:** `platform_layer/types.rs`
    *   **Action:** Add `SetControlTooltip { window_id: WindowId, control_id: i32, tooltip_text: Option<String> }`.

2.  **(PL-Exec & PL-State) Implement Tooltip Logic:**
    *   **Action:** Implement the logic to create a tooltip control (`TOOLTIPS_CLASSW`) per window and use `TTM_ADDTOOLW` to associate text with a control's `HWND`.
    *   **Styling:** To style the tooltip itself, it must be created with the `TTS_OWNERDRAW` style. This requires handling `WM_DRAWITEM` for the tooltip, which is an advanced step.
    *   **Simpler Alternative:** A simpler first step is to accept the default system tooltip appearance. Full custom styling can be a follow-on task.

3.  **(UIDL) Add Tooltips:**
    *   **Action:** After creating a button or other control, send a `SetControlTooltip` command.

**Verification:** Hovering over a control with a configured tooltip displays the text.
